# AiRS: AI Resume Scorer ðŸš€

## Overview

**AiRS (AI Resume Scorer)** is a web application designed to help users optimize their resumes for better job matches. Using advanced AI models, the tool evaluates resumes against job descriptions, providing detailed feedback and scoring based on various resume components such as grammar, structure, action verbs, and quantifiable achievements.

- **Component-Based Scoring**: Breaks down the resume evaluation into specific components, such as grammar, structure, and use of action verbs, to provide targeted feedback.
- **Visualizations**: Provides visual representations of the resume scores using bar charts and pie charts, helping users easily identify strengths and weaknesses.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Built using Streamlit, the application offers an intuitive interface with easy-to-use features, such as file uploads and job description inputs.
